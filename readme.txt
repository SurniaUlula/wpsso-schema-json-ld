== Description ==

<p style="margin:0;"><img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso-schema-json-ld/assets/icon-256x256.png"></p>

**Uses your pre-existing WordPress content and plugin / API data for accurate and comprehensive Schema JSON-LD markup:**

Including image SEO, video SEO, local business, organization, publisher, person, author and co-authors, extensive e-Commerce product markup, product variations, product ratings, aggregate ratings, reviews, recipe information, event details, collection pages, profile pages, search pages, item lists for [Google's Carousel Rich Results](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/mark-up-listings), customized property values, and much, much more (see below for Standard and Premium version details).

Offers Schema JSON-LD markup for posts, pages, custom post types, terms (category, tags, etc.), custom taxonomies, user profile pages, search result pages, Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) pages, etc.

**Most complete Schema JSON-LD markup for WooCommerce products:**

The WooCommerce plugin is known to provide incomplete Schema markup for Google. The <a href="https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso/">WPSSO Core Premium plugin</a> and its <a href="https://wpsso.com/extend/plugins/wpsso-schema-json-ld/">WPSSO JSON Premium add-on</a> provide a far better solution by offering complete Facebook / Pinterest Product meta tags and Schema Product markup for Google Rich Results / Rich Snippets &mdash; including additional product images, product variations, product attributes (brand, color, condition, EAN, dimensions, GTIN-8/12/13/14, ISBN, material, MPN, size, SKU, weight, etc), product reviews, product ratings, sale start / end dates, sale prices, pre-tax prices, VAT prices, and much, much more ([markup for a see an example WooCommerce test product](https://wpsso.com/docs/plugins/wpsso-schema-json-ld/notes/markup-examples/markup-example-for-a-woocommerce-product/)).

**Fixes all Google Search Console / Structured Data Testing Tool errors:**

The Standard and Premium versions both fix all Google testing tool errors for their supported Schema types:

* A value for the *headline* field is required.
* A value for the *image* field is required.
* A value for the *logo* field is required.
* A value for the *publisher* field is required.
* The *aggregateRating* field is recommended.
* The *brand* field is recommended.
* The *headline* field is recommended.
* The *image* field is recommended.
* The *mainEntityOfPage* field is recommended.
* The *review* field is recommended.
* This Product is missing a global identifier.
* etc.

Google regularly updates and changes their Schema markup requirements - WPSSO JSON Premium customers can also <a href="https://surniaulula.com/support/">open a Premium support ticket for assistance</a> with any new Google testing tool errors.

Additional e-Commerce plugin integration is also provided with the WPSSO Core Premium plugin, including Easy Digital Downloads and WP eCommerce.
