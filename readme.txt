WPSSO Core add-on to provide Schema JSON-LD / SEO markup for Articles, Events, Local Business, Products, Recipes, Reviews and many more.

== Description ==

<img class="readme-icon" src="https://surniaulula.github.io/wpsso-schema-json-ld/assets/icon-256x256.png">

**Provides *comprehensive* and *accurate* Schema JSON-LD markup for Google's Knowledge Graph and Rich Cards:**

Including image SEO, video SEO, local business, organization, publisher, person, author and co-authors, extensive eCommerce product markup, product variations, product ratings, aggregate ratings, reviews, recipe information, event details, collection pages, profile pages, search pages, item lists for Google's mobile carousel, customized property values, and much, much more (see the list of features bellow for Free / Pro version details).

**Includes special markup and optimization features for Pinterest:**

As Pinterest does not currently read Schema JSON-LD markup, WPSSO Core and its WPSSO Schema JSON-LD Markup add-on include special features to provide different Schema meta tags for Pinterest, along with preventing conflicts between incompatible Pinterest and Facebook meta tag values.

**Allows selecting a different Schema than BlogPosting for your AMP pages.**

**Complete product markup for WooCommerce, including all variations (Pro version):**

WooCommerce product markup includes all product images, product variations, product attributes (weight, size, color, material, etc), product reviews, product ratings, and much more. Additional e-Commerce plugins are also supported, including Easy Digital Downloads, MarketPress, and WP eCommerce.
